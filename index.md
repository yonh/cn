# We have already learned words

```
我, 你, 他, 她, 爱
爸爸, 妈妈, 哥哥, 弟弟, 姐姐, 妹妹
```



# Now we can say

```
# I love ?(person/any thing you love.  e.g. car,guitar,book,song...
											bara bara if you know the word in Chinese)
我爱你 (I love you)
我爱爸爸妈妈(I love father,mother)

```





# 03 是(shi) and 的(de) 

In English we would say "I am", "You are", "She is", But in the Chinese we don't distinguish "am"、"are"、"is". We just using "是(shi)" in all.

For example

I am father.   ->   我是(shi)爸爸.

You are mother.   ->   你是(shi)妈妈.

She is older sister.   ->   她是(shi)姐姐.

He is older brother.   ->   他是(shi)哥哥.



and then we will learn "We","You" and "They", In Chinese We also add one word of "I,You,He", like 是(shi).

But in this word we will use `们(men)`.

For example.

We    -> 我们(men)

You   -> 你们(men)

They -> `他们`(men), ` 她们`(they are all woman),  `它们`(no humanity are there)



> NOTES
>
> 
>
> 1.  But if you know they are all woman, you can say `她们` or` 他们`.
> 2.  But if you know they are not humanity. You can only say `它们`.
> 3. We just use `他,她` for humanity. `它` for not humanity.
> 4. Please remember in Chinese, we don't have countable nonu and uncountable noun, so
>    1. teachers and teache in Chinese both is `老师`
>    2. students and student in Chinese both is `学生`

#### Exercise

```
I love my father           -> 我爱我的爸爸
My father loves me         -> 我的爸爸爱我
I love they(men and woman) -> 我爱他们
I love they(just men)      -> 我爱他们
I love they(just woman)    -> 我爱她们
I am teacher               -> 我是学生(student)
They are teachers          -> 他们是老师
```
